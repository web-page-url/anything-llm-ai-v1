# Railway Deployment Checklist for Aditi Consulting AI

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### âœ… Files Created/Updated
- [ ] `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build optimized for Railway
- [ ] `docker-entrypoint.sh` - Startup script with proper error handling
- [ ] `.dockerignore` - Optimized to exclude unnecessary files
- [ ] `railway.toml` - Railway-specific configuration
- [ ] `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- [ ] `test-docker.ps1` / `test-docker.sh` - Local testing scripts

### âœ… Docker Configuration
- [ ] Multi-stage build for optimization
- [ ] Non-root user for security
- [ ] Proper health checks
- [ ] Environment variable handling
- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling
- [ ] Railway PORT environment variable support

### âœ… Application Configuration
- [ ] Database migrations on startup
- [ ] Prisma client generation
- [ ] Storage directory creation
- [ ] Error handling and logging
- [ ] Health check endpoint (`/api/ping`)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Local Testing (Optional but Recommended)
```powershell
# Windows
.\test-docker.ps1

# Linux/Mac
./test-docker.sh
```

### 2. Railway Deployment
1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Railway deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository
   - Railway will automatically detect Dockerfile and deploy

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   Required:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   
   Optional (with secure defaults):
   - `JWT_SECRET` (generate with: `openssl rand -hex 32`)
   - `SIG_KEY` (generate with: `openssl rand -hex 32`)
   - `SIG_SALT` (generate with: `openssl rand -hex 32`)
   
   AI Provider Keys (if using external services):
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - etc.

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Application builds successfully
- [ ] Container starts without errors
- [ ] Health check passes (`/api/ping` returns 200)
- [ ] Database migrations complete
- [ ] Frontend loads correctly
- [ ] Document upload works
- [ ] Chat functionality works
- [ ] AI responses work (if API keys configured)

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
1. Check build logs in Railway dashboard
2. Verify all dependencies are properly specified
3. Check for syntax errors in Dockerfile

### Runtime Issues
1. Check application logs in Railway dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Check database connection and migrations
4. Verify storage permissions

### Common Solutions
- **Out of memory**: Upgrade Railway plan
- **Build timeout**: Optimize Dockerfile or upgrade plan
- **Database issues**: Check DATABASE_URL and migrations
- **Port binding**: Ensure PORT environment variable is used

## Security Checklist
- [ ] Strong JWT_SECRET, SIG_KEY, and SIG_SALT
- [ ] Environment variables for sensitive data
- [ ] Non-root user in container
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (automatic with Railway)
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Multi-stage Docker build
- [ ] Optimized .dockerignore
- [ ] Proper caching layers
- [ ] Health checks configured
- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling

## Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Railway dashboard monitoring enabled
- [ ] Health check endpoint working
- [ ] Log aggregation configured
- [ ] Error tracking setup

## Backup Strategy
- [ ] Database backup plan
- [ ] Document storage backup
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Deployment configuration versioned

## Final Verification Commands

### Test Health Check
```bash
curl -f https://your-app.railway.app/api/ping
```

### Test Frontend
```bash
curl -I https://your-app.railway.app/
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# Via Railway CLI
railway logs

# Via Dashboard
# Go to your project > Deployments > View Logs
```

## Success Criteria
- âœ… Application accessible via Railway URL
- âœ… Health check returns `{"online": true}`
- âœ… Frontend loads without errors
- âœ… Database operations work
- âœ… File uploads work
- âœ… Chat functionality works
- âœ… No critical errors in logs

## Next Steps After Deployment
1. Configure custom domain (optional)
2. Set up monitoring alerts
3. Configure backups
4. Add team members
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline
6. Performance tuning
7. Security hardening
